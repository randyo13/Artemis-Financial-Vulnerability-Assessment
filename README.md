# Artemis-Financial-Vulnerability-Assessment

# Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
# What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
# Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
# How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
# How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
# What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
# Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

  My client was a financial services company called Artemis Financial. They required a robust encryption solution to protect sensitive client data. The company wanted to address vulnerabilities in its web-based software application to ensure its clients' information was safeguarded against security threats. I conducted a vulnerability assessment to identify and mitigate key vulnerabilities, particularly in cryptography and client-server communication. I recommended using AES-256 encryption and implemented SHA-256 for checksum generation. I also secured API interactions with HTTPS to strengthen the software's security layers. By enhancing encryption methods and securing communication channels, I addressed the client's vulnerabilities. Secure coding protects sensitive information, prevents unauthorized access, and reduces cyberattack risks, making it extremely important. Software security provides a safeguard for a company's data, builds trust with customers, and ensures compliance with industry best practices. The most challenging part was securing API interactions with HTTPS; despite following the steps, the certificate did not show as a secured connection. I added encryption methods and attempted to secure communication channels using HTTPS to increase security layers. In the future, I would use vulnerability scanners to assess vulnerabilities and select mitigation techniques. To ensure the code and software were functional, I performed secondary testing followed by functional testing to verify that the refactored code ran without errors. Afterward, another dependency check could be conducted to see if any new vulnerabilities were introduced. The use of secure coding practices and encryption libraries are good resources and tools that can help in future assignments. From this assignment, I believe I can show future employers my work on enhancing encryption and the refactoring process, which demonstrates my skills in software security and functionality in real-world applications.
